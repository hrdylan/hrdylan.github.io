# DJ Hero

DJ Hero is a web app for sharing and leveraging party music tastes. It allows users to share their preferences and create party playlist based on the preferences of their guests. This project is a wizard-of-oz implementation of the DJ Hero UI. It supports 4 key features - account sign-in/creation, preference sharing, party playlist creation, and music discovery. 

As our design developed from wireframe to prototype we made to major changes. After user's we interviewed expressed difficulty with party playlist creation, which was originally a single page, we sub-divided the feature into smaller tasks using a carousel. Users move through each sub-task to complete the larger task of party playlist creation. Initially, our UI expressed two different personas the user could take-on, a party "Thrower" and a party "Goer". While these terms we useful to us in development, they confused users in our early interview. Our users wanted to be both personas at the same time and were confused by the distinction. Therefore, we changed the personas into features:preference sharing and party playlist creation.
